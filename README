1]This project implements a simple form of Distance Vector algorithm using Bellman-Ford equation.

2]Usage:-  ./servr -t <topologyfile> -i <timeout>

3]UDP sockets have been used in this project to exchange routing updates between the servers.For simplicity 
  routing updates are only sent on 'timeout' and when user updates links or asks for and update.

4]The routers listen for routing updates from neighbors and if they dont receive these after 3 timeout intervals
  then cost link is set to infinity.

5]The links between the neighbors can be disabled by user following which the router will stop listening and sending
  updates to that neighbor.A link once disabled cannot be enabled again.In such case if possible alternate route 
  will be calculated.

6]Update command can be used to change link costs between neighbors.


7]A crash can be simulated which causes the server to stop listening and sending updates after which it waits
  for 'exit' command to quit.A server cannot function again once crashed,the program has to be restartd.

8]*The router will automatically display the routing table when updated.If not then display command can be used.
  The routes are updated but doesnot display sometimes in such cases 'display command' can be used.

9]Packets command gives no of packets received last since command was invoked.


10]All command return either a success or a failure message.

11]Exit command can be used to exit the router(server).
